#### Brief Description of your Solution - 
The social media platform that we are creating is designed for people who are passionate about trying out new food and sharing their experiences with friends. The platform will allow users to create profiles, connect with friends, and share photos and reviews of their favorite meals and restaurants.

One of the main features of the platform will be the ability for restaurants to create profiles and add their menus under various categories such as cuisine type, price range, and location. Users will be able to search for restaurants based on these categories and also leave reviews and ratings for the restaurants they visit.

Another key feature of the platform will be a notice board section where users can post information about food-related events such as food festivals, charity events, and food donation drives. This section will allow users to stay updated on the latest food-related events in their area and also get involved in charitable causes.

In addition to these features, the platform will also have a news feed where users can view updates from their friends and other users they follow. They can also comment and like on these posts, and share their own photos and experiences.

Overall, our social media platform aims to create a community of food enthusiasts who can connect with each other, discover new restaurants and cuisines, and share their love for food.
